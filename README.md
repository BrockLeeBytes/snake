# Snake
A recreation of the game Snake for a desktop web browser. 

This version of snake uses HTML, CSS, javascript(for the game logic) and jQuery(for manipulating the DOM).

To play the game you can clone this repo and open index.html. The file should open automatically in your default browser. When the page loads, press the enter key to start the game and use the directional keys to move the snake.

## Features to be added/ Feature wishlist

* Increase snake speed upon X amount of food eaten.

* Power ups. Example: Different colored objects that upon being eaten slows snake speed for limited time, decreases body length, adds multiple sources of food at once, ect...

* Stylistic changes. This game has simple but ugly graphics. Should definately be improved.
